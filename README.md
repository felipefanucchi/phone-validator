# phone-validator

I created this simple algorithm, to solve a problem, maybe help someone else, or even improve this code.

Basically, this code, will verify the numbers, let's suppose, in the target.value, will be repeat, or even
intercalated between itself.

I just separated into to numbers, and check with they next and after next sibling. And if the after next sibling it's 
equal, I'll do another verification, that checks if the second is equal the fourth, and then I have another sequence.
